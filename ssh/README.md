## ssh

Check user RSA ssh file permissions

This script allows users to make sure that the ssh files and directory permissions are correct and corrected if not correct.  Administrators can check other users ssh keys by using: sudo /usr/local/bin/check-user-ssh.sh <SSH-USER>.  Currently not supporting id_dsa.pub.

    drwx------  2 uadmin uadmin 4096 Mar  5 13:55 .
    drwxr-xr-x 15 uadmin uadmin 4096 Mar 10 19:22 ..
    -rw-------  1 uadmin uadmin 3563 Feb 22 12:27 authorized_keys
    -rw-------  1 uadmin uadmin 1675 Oct  7 20:37 id_rsa
    -rw-r--r--  1 uadmin uadmin  398 Oct  7 20:37 id_rsa.pub
    -rw-r--r--  1 uadmin uadmin 5324 Mar  1 14:38 known_hosts

To create a new ssh key; ssh-keygen -t rsa
Users can enter the following command to test if public and private key match:
diff -qs <(ssh-keygen -yf ~/.ssh/id_rsa) <(cut -d ' ' -f 1,2 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

Repeat the SSH login with the -vvv for verbose mode to help resolve this incident.
ssh -vvv uthree@192.168.1.203
