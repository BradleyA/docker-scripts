## ssh
### Description
Check user RSA ssh file permissions

This script allows users to make sure that the ssh files and directory permissions are correct.  If they are not correct then this script will correct the permissions.  Administrators can check other users ssh keys by using: sudo /usr/local/bin/check-user-ssh.sh <SSH-USER>.  Currently not supporting id_dsa.pub.

    drwx------  2 uadmin uadmin 4096 Mar  5 13:55 .
    drwxr-xr-x 15 uadmin uadmin 4096 Mar 10 19:22 ..
    -rw-------  1 uadmin uadmin 3563 Feb 22 12:27 authorized_keys
    -rw-------  1 uadmin uadmin  450 Aug  9 11:15 config
    -rw-------  1 uadmin uadmin 1675 Oct  7 20:37 id_rsa
    -rw-r--r--  1 uadmin uadmin  398 Oct  7 20:37 id_rsa.pub
    -rw-------  1 uadmin uadmin 3420 Jul 27 19:16 known_hosts

### Clone
To install, change to the location you want to download the scripts. Use git to pull or clone these scripts into the directory. If you do not have git then enter; "sudo apt-get install git". On the github page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command.

    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/docker-scripts
    cd docker-scripts/ssh
    
    mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    mv ./check-user-ssh.sh  /usr/local/bin
    cd ../..
    rm -rf docker-scripts

### Usage
Check user, uadmin, RSA ssh file permissions

    ./check-user-ssh.sh
    
### Output
    Verify and correct file and directory permissions for /home/uadmin/.ssh
    
    List of authorized hosts in /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys:
    
    uadmin@four-rpi3b
    uadmin@one-rpi3b
    uadmin@six-rpi3b
    uadmin@three-rpi3b
    uadmin@two
    uadmin@two-rpi3b
    uthree@three
    
    To remove a host from /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

	REMOVE_HOST='<user_name>@<host_name>'
	grep -v $REMOVE_HOST /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys > /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys.new
	mv /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys.new /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys
    
    Check if all files in /home/uadmin/.ssh directory are owned
    by uadmin.  If files are not owned by uadmin then list them below:
    
    Check if uadmin private key and public key are a
    matched set (identical) or not a matched set (differ):
    
    Files /dev/fd/63 and /dev/fd/62 are identical
    
    ./check-user-ssh.sh 148 [INFO]:  Done.

### ssh Hints
To create a new ssh key;

    ssh-keygen -t rsa

To check if a private key and public key are a matched set (identical) or not a matched set (differ):
    
    diff -qs <(ssh-keygen -yf ~/.ssh/id_rsa) <(cut -d ' ' -f 1,2 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

To debug SSH login use the -vvv for verbose mode to help resolve this incident.

    ssh -vvv <user_name>@<host>
    
To remove a host from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

    REMOVE_HOST='<user_name>@<host_name>'
    grep -v $REMOVE_HOST /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys > /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys.new
    mv /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys.new /home/uadmin/.ssh/authorized_keys

### System OS script tested
