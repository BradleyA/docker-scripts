# docker-TLS-scripts
create-site-private-public-tls.sh, create-new-openssl.cnf-tls.sh, create-user-tls.sh, and create-host-tls.sh are bash scripts that create TLS public keys, private keys, and self-signed certificates for the docker user, daemon, and swarm.  After many reinstalls of OS's and Docker, I got tried of entering the cryptic command line text required to setup Docker to use TLS.  Each example I found on-line was different than the last example.

create-site-private-public-tls.sh - Run this script first on your host that will be creating all your TLS keys.  It creates the site private and public keys that all other TLS keys at your site will be using.  It creates the working directories  $HOME/.docker/docker-ca and $HOME/.docker/docker-ca/.private for your site public and private keys.  These site cerificates are set for two years until new certificates are needed.  You may change the default two years (730 days) by including a parameter with the number of days you prefer.  At that time this script will need to be run to create another set of two year public and private site certificates.  If you choose to use a different host to continue creating your user and host TLS keys, cp the $HOME/.docker/docker-ca and $HOME/.docker/docker-ca/.private to the new host and run create-new-openssl.cnf-tls.sh scipt.

create-new-openssl.cnf-tls.sh - Run this script second, it is required to make changes to the openssl.cnf file on your host which are required for the create-user-tls and create-host-tls scripts.  It is only required to run once on your host that will be creating all your TLS keys.  If you choose to use a different host to continue creating your user and host TLS keys, run this script on the new host before running the follow two scripts.

create-user-tls.sh - The order of the last two scripts does not matter as long as they are run on your host that is creating all the TLS keys.  See notes about using a different host in the first two scripts.  Run this script any time a user requires a new Docker public and private TLS key.

create-host-tls.sh - The order of the last two scripts does not matter as long as they are run on your host that is creating all the TLS keys.  See notes about using a different host in the first two scripts.  Run this script any time a host requires a new Docker public and private TLS key.

check-user-tls.sh - A user can check their public, private keys, and CA in $HOME/.docker or a user can check other users certificates by using sudo.

check-host-tls.sh - Checks host public, private keys, and CA in /etc/docker/certs.d/daemon

## Install
To install, change directory to the location you want to download the scripts.  Use git to pull or clone these scripts into your directory.  If you do not have git then enter; "sudo apt-get install git".  On the github page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command. 
    
    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/docker-scripts
    cd docker-scripts/docker-TLS-scripts
    
Move the scripts or create a symbolic link to a location in your working path; example /usr/local/bin. To find directories in your working path use; "echo $PATH".
    
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv  c*.sh /usr/local/bin
    cd ../..
    rm -r docker-scripts

## Usage
Run this script first on your host to create your site private and public TLS keys.  To change the default number of days (730 days = 2 years) enter a number of days as the parameter (example: create-site-private-public-tls 365 ).

    create-site-private-public-tls.sh <#days>

## Output
    $ ./create-site-private-public-tls.sh
    mkdir: created directory '/home/uadmin/.docker/docker-ca'
    mkdir: created directory '/home/uadmin/.docker/docker-ca/.private'

    Once all the certificates and keys have been generated with this private key,
    it would be prudent to move the private key to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory stick.
    Remove the private key from all systems and store the USB memory stick in a locked
    fireproof location.

    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank

    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

    ./create-site-private-public-tls.sh 39 [INFO]:	These certificate are valid for 730 days.
    
    It would be prudent to document the date when to renew these certificates and set
    an operations or project management calendar entry about 15 days before renewal as
    a reminder to schedule new site certificates.

## Usage
Run this script second on your host that be used to create all your certificates.  It makes a change to the openssl.cnf file.

    sudo ./create-new-openssl.cnf-tls.sh

## Output
    $ sudo ./create-new-openssl.cnf-tls
    This script will make changes to the openssl.cnf file.  These changes are required
    before creating user and host TLS files for Docker.  Run this script before running
    the user and host TLS scripts.  It is not required to be run on hosts not creating TLS files.
