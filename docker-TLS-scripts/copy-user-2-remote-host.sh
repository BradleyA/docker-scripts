#	Copy public and private key and CA for user to remote host
#	This script uses two arguements;
#		TLSUSER - user
#		REMOTEHOST - name of host to copy certificates 
# >>>>> This scrip 
#	Documentation: https://github.com/BradleyA/docker-scripts/tree/master/docker-TLS-scripts
#	use case 1 TLSUSER is able to copy TLS keys and CA to remote system with same user ID
#	use case 2 uadmin is able to copy TLS keys and CA to remote system with another USER ID
#		and chown chmod and write to remote user home directory 
#	think about using tar to create transfer and untar then chown and chmod
#	need a host version that copies keys and cert to remote system in secure directory to untar

#	will require more logic to support all use cases and updated prompts
#	uadmin is the account for site and all clusters
#	may want to see how to support more than one uadmin account in clusters for this script
#	this opens up challenge with different users needing to chown and chgrp for different remote users
