# create-docker-TLS-scripts
create-site-private-public-tls.sh, create-new-openssl.cnf-tls.sh, create-client-tls.sh, and create-host-tls.sh are bash scripts that create TLS public keys, private keys, and self-signed certificates for the docker user, daemon, and swarm.  After many reinstalls of OS's and Docker, I got tried of entering the cryptic command line text required to setup Docker to use TLS.  Each example I found on-line was different than the last example.

create-site-private-public-tls.sh - Run this script first on your host that will be creating all your TLS keys.  It creates the site private and public keys that all other TLS keys at your site will be using.  It creates the working directories  $HOME/.docker/docker-ca and $HOME/.docker/docker-ca/.private for your site public and private keys.  These site cerificates are set for four years until new certificates are needed.  You may change the default four year (1460) by including a parameter with the number of days you prefer.  At that time this script will need to be run to create another set of four year public and private site certificates.  If you choose to use a different host to continue creating your client and host TLS keys, cp the $HOME/.docker/docker-ca and $HOME/.docker/docker-ca/.private to the new host.

create-new-openssl.cnf-tls.sh - Run this script second, it is required to make changes to the openssl.cnf file on your host which are required for the create-client-tls and create-host-tls scripts.  It is only required to run once on your host that will be creating all your TLS keys.  If you choose to use a different host to continue creating your client and host TLS keys, run this script on the new host before running the follow two scripts.

create-client-tls.sh - The order of the last two scripts does not matter as long as they are run on your host that is creating all the TLS keys.  See notes about using a different host in the first two scripts.  Run this script any time a user requires a new Docker public and private TLS key.

create-host-tls.sh - The order of the last two scripts does not matter as long as they are run on your host that is creating all the TLS keys.  See notes about using a different host in the first two scripts.  Run this script any time a host requires a new Docker public and private TLS key.

## Install
To install, change directory to the location you want to download the scripts.  Use git to pull or clone these scripts into your directory.  If you do not have git then enter; "sudo apt-get install git".  On the github page of this script use the "HTTPS clone URL" with the 'git clone' command. 
    
    git clone https://github.com/BradleyA/Create-docker-TLS-scripts.1.0.git
    cd Create-docker-TLS-scripts.1.0
    
Move the scripts or create a symbolic link to a location in your working path; example /usr/local/bin. To find directories in your working path use; "echo $PATH".
    
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv create-*-tls /usr/local/bin
    cd ..
    rm -r Create-docker-TLS-scripts.1.0
    chmod 0750 /usr/local/bin/create-*-tls

## Usage
Run this script first on your host to create your site private and public TLS keys.  To change the default number of days (1460 days = 4 years) enter a number of days as the parameter (example: create-site-private-public-tls 365 ).

    create-site-private-public-tls.sh

## Output
    $ ./create-site-private-public-tls.sh
    mkdir: created directory '/home/uadmin/.docker/docker-ca'

    Once all the certificates and keys have been generated with this private key,
    it would be prudent to move the private key to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory stick.
    Remove the private key from all systems and store the USB memory stick in a locked
    fireproof location.
    
    ./create-site-private-public-tls.sh 24 [INFO]:	Creating public key good for 1460 days in /home/uadmin/.docker/docker-ca
    
    The public key is copied to all systems in an environment so that those systems
    trust signed certificates.
    The following is a list of prompts from the following command and example answers are
    in parentheses.
    Country Name (US)
    State or Province Name (Texas)
    Locality Name (Cedar Park)
    Organization Name (Company Name)
    Organizational Unit Name (IT)
    Common Name (two.cptx86.com)

    Enter pass phrase for .private/ca-priv-key.pem:
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

    Email Address []:
    
    ./create-site-private-public-tls.sh 39 [INFO]:	These certificate are valid for 1460 days.
    
    It would be prudent to document the date when to renew these certificates and set
    an operations or project management calendar entry about 15 days before renewal as
    a reminder to schedule new site certificates.

## Usage
Run this script second on your host that be used to create all your certificates.  It makes a change to the openssl.cnf file.

    sudo ./create-new-openssl.cnf-tls.sh

## Output
    $ sudo ./create-new-openssl.cnf-tls
    This script will make changes to the openssl.cnf file.  These changes are required
    before creating user and host TLS files for Docker.  Run this script before running
    the user and host TLS scripts.  It is not required to be run on hosts not creating TLS files.

    environment variables will be set each time the user logs into the test computer system.  Edit your .bashrc
