###	Configure dockerd (systemd) on Ubuntu 16.04
#
#	Any changes to dockerd-configuration-file will be added to the override file during 
#		the next boot or when ${START_SYSTEMD_SCRIPT} is run.

DROP_IN_DIRECTORY="/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d"
OVERRIDE_FILE="10-override"
WORK_DIRECTORY="/etc/docker/"

/bin/echo -e "\n${0} ${LINENO} [INFO]:       Creating ${OVERRIDE_FILE}.conf and moving it to ${DROP_IN_DIRECTORY}." 1>&2
#	Copy ${WORK_DIRECTORY}${OVERRIDE_FILE}.begin to ${WORK_DIRECTORY}${OVERRIDE_FILE}.conf
/bin/cp --force ${WORK_DIRECTORY}${OVERRIDE_FILE}.begin ${WORK_DIRECTORY}${OVERRIDE_FILE}.conf
#	Append the following line with $DOCKER_OPTS onto ${WORK_DIRECTORY}${OVERRIDE_FILE}.conf
/bin/echo "ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd ${DOCKER_OPTS}" >> ${WORK_DIRECTORY}${OVERRIDE_FILE}.conf
#       Create docker.service drop-in directory for override file (${OVERRIDE_FILE}.conf)
/bin/mkdir -p ${DROP_IN_DIRECTORY}
#	Move override file into docker.service.d directory
/bin/mv --force ${WORK_DIRECTORY}${OVERRIDE_FILE}.conf ${DROP_IN_DIRECTORY}
#	Unable to get docker.service to reload 10-override.conf file changes if any during boot.
#	/bin/systemctl reload docker.service
#	This is the warning I received when uncommenting the previous line.  Responce received during testing:
#		Warning: docker.service changed on disk.  Run 'systemctl daemon-reload' to reload units.
#	/bin/systemctl daemon-reload
#	No change when uncommenting the previous line.  I think systemd is not up yet so systemctl daemon-reload can not be used during boot.
